    schema:description """This catalogue contains Semantic Web renditions of the codelists and codesets presented in the ISO's 19* series of geographic information/geomantic standards.

These renditions are encoded using the human- and machine-readable [Resource Description Framework](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) conforming to the [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)[https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/] data model for taxonomies/vocabularies. This allows for simple enough human reading - RDF files are text files - but also automated validating, automated absorption into databases, multi-codelist indexing, searching and so on.

TC-211 standards of the ISO 19* series are about "Geographic information/Geomatics" and many of those standards contain codelists of terms that are used within the standards' data models. For example, the standard [ISO 19115-1:2014 Geographic information — Metadata — Part 1: Fundamentals (ISO19115-1)](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html) contains the codelist [_Association Type Codes_](https://def.isotc211.org/DS/AssociationTypeCode) which gives values for the _associationType_ property defined as identifying the "type of relation between the resources" (Table B.3.6 — Association information).

The _Association Type Codes_ codelist and many others have previously been delivered online as non-ISO-sponsored publications in Semantic Web form. It is hoped that these unauthorised copies can be replaced with these authorised ones.

The codelists/codesets in this form and at this location are the authoritative publications of their information for TC-211 and other renditions of them in XML etc., even by TC-211 in documents, are not authoritative.

The codelists and codesets are presented as objects within subsidary catalogues of this one that preserve the previous and current TC-211 standard's model management. Previously published codelists are in CI, DS and so on catalogues, where as some previous codelists and all future codesets are in the common catalogue.""" ;
